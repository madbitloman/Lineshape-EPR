# epr_lineshapes
EPR linehses computation via Kubo-Anderson model. Originally ode is transformed from the java version for N-D arrays inversion
but optimized and speeded up with numpy libraries. More work to do on efficient matrix assignment. 

I suggest to use generalizedlineshape.py as it is currently the only script I maintain.
